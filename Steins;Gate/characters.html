            <p>The story's protagonist. A freshman at Tokyo Denki University. More than a little eccentric, Okabe - aka Okarin - fancies himself a mad scientist on a quest to overthrow the shadowy Organization and plunge the world into chaos. He likes to talk to himself on his phone, give people nicknames, and rant about conspiracies, but seems blessedly unaware of the strange looks this behavior attracts.</p>
            <p>Okabe leads the Future Gadget Laboratory, a small group consisting of himself and his (only) two friends. They spend their time inventing useless gadgets and giving them "cool" names.</p>
