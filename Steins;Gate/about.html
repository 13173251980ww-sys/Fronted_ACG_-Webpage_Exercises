            <h2>Phone Triggers</h2>
            <p>STEINS;GATE does not use the standard choice system found in most visual novel-style adventure games. Instead, players interact with the game through the protagonist's cellphone. Answer or ignore calls, send and receive emails -- the same choices that you make in everyday life steer the course of the story and affect your relationships with the other characters.</p>

            <h2>D-MAIL</h2>
            <p>The primary method of altering the timeline featured in Steins;Gate. D-Mail, short for DeLorean Mail, is an unintended function of the PhoneWave, a phone-controlled microwave built by the Future Gadget Laboratory. Originally, the PhoneWave was designed merely to accept commands sent to the attached cellphone, but a freak accident revealed that it could also be used to send emails into the past. Of course, there must be a device on the other end to receive the email, which limits the possible range of effect. In addition, only 36 bytes of data can be sent at one time.</p>
            <p>The protagonist and narrator of Steins;Gate, Okarin, does not like the name "PhoneWave", so he always adds "(name subject to change)" when he uses it.</p>

            <h2>Time Leap</h2>
            <img src="images/about_timeleap.jpg">
            <p>A form of time travel made possible by combining D-Mail technology with Makise Kurisu's research on memory storage in the brain. First, the subject's memories are converted to digital data. That data is then compressed into a D-Mail and sent into the past, where it is downloaded into the recipient's brain.</p>
            <p>This process has three strict limitations. First, memory data cannot be sent back farther than the invention of the PhoneWave; second, you can only send memories into your own brain; third, the target "you" must have a cellphone at the time of reception.</p>
